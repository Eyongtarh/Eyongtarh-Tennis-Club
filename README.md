### Media Queries 

The site works on different screen sizes but not perfectly. This is partly because 
I commented out the media queries made in the stylesheet. BUt mainly because the 
queries work for specific sizes and not for ranges.

### Validation Testing

-HTML shows one bug error returned when passing through the official W3C validator.
