                    <h3>Children Trainee</h3>
                    <p> We have adopted a pedagogy that the International Tennis
                        Federation has developed. That is, balls, rackets and playing
                        fields are adapted to the level and age of the players. The Play & Stay concept
                        means that we use different balls that bounce differently, fast and high depending
                        on the height and level of development of the players.<br><br>
                        The result has been that our players relatively and quickly develop a better physique and
                        footwork,
                        better and more functionalstrokes and better tactics where it is possible to play "real tennis
                        duels" at a relatively early age. This in turn creates joy for the game and that is exactly what
                        is our most important goal. This is our approach. Book time with us to get you started.<br><br>

                        today within the framework of our program for recreational and exercise purposes. Our goal
                        is to always offer tennis training in many different forms and something for non competitive
                        players. <br><br>
                        We offer courses for beginners to more advanced players. This is in the form of weekly

                        begin

                        juniors as well as our competitive seniors and veterans.
