                <h3>Children Trainee</h3>
                <p> We have adopted a pedagogy that the International Tennis
                    Federation has developed. That is, balls, rackets and playing
                    fields are adapted to the level and age of the players. The Play & Stay concept
                    means that we use different balls that bounce differently, fast and high depending
                    on the height and level of development of the players. The result has been that our
                    players relatively quickly develop a better physique and footwork, better and more functional
                    strokes and better tactics where it is possible to play "real tennis duels" at a relatively
                    early age. This in turn creates joy for the game and that is exactly what is our most
                    important goal. This is our approach. Book time with us to get you started.

                <h3>Recreational Player</h3>
                <p> We provide adequate guidance to students as well as energetic pensioners who can be accommodated
                    today within the framework of our program for recreational and exercise purposes. Our goal
                    is to always offer tennis training in many different forms and something for non competitive
                    players. We offer courses for beginners to more advanced players. This is in the form of weekly
                    courses, private lessons in groups or individually and exercise series. Book time so you can begin
                    your journey.

                <h3>Competitive Player</h3>
                <p> Our competition activities includes our representative teams, the competitive
                    juniors as well as our competitive seniors and veterans.
                    Our goal is to give children and young people who have an interest in tennis and especially
                    the competitive aspect a solid and well thought out sports education of the highest quality.
                    We want to offer the best development environment and create the conditions for players
                    who want to make a tennis investment with the goal of reaching regional,
                    national or international top levels.
